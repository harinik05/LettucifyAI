    "# Distributed GPU Training Job for PyTorch Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide a technical documentation for a greater accelerated training process. This is done through a methodological approach known as distributed GPU training process. This involves a multi-node multi-gpu pytorch job, wherin MLFlow was used to analyze the metrics.  \n",
